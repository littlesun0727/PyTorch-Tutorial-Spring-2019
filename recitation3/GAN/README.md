# Generative Advesarial Nets
There are three folders:
1. Pipeline: Contains the codes of a series of necesary commands and functions. 
2. Architecture: Contains the codes for building the models.
3. Data: Contains the codes for loading and processing data.
## Notes
Trainig GAN is time-consuming, so I suggest starting with MNSIT and training with a high-performance GPU like GTX 1060. If you are interested in generating nature pictures, you need to modify the parameters like increasing the number of feature maps and use larger neural networks.
