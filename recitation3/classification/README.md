# Visual BackProp + ResNet
There are three folders:
1. Pipeline: Contains the codes of a series of necesary commands and functions. 
2. Architecture: Contains the codes for building the models.
3. Data: Contains the codes for loading and processing data.

## Notes
This classification experiemnt is more complex since the neural networks are used for nature image classification. Several points need to be noticed:
1. Residual Blocks: The core contribution of ResNet.
2. VisualBackProp: Efficient visualization of convolutional neural networks.
3. Adam Optimizer: One of the most popular optimizers for training large networks.
